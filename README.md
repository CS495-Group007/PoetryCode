# Sprint 2 Test Cases
1. The user should be able to click the boxes on the instructor dashboard to view student statuses on each poem
    
 - Tested this feature by clicking on all of the dummy data students we have currently in our app and verifying that their progress matches up with the progress that we have in our dummy database.


2. The user should be able to click a poem on the poem dashboard to link to the corresponding gameboard page

  - First, we navigated to the student dashboard. Then we clicked on Sonnet 4. We verified that the poem name and text were correct. We then verified that the poem key was correct by playing the game.


3. The user should be able to navigate the site with the navbar
  
  - To test this, we clicked on each link in the nav bar and noted that it took us to the correct page.


4. The user should be able to check their work against the answer key.
  
  - To test this, we loaded up Sonnet 4. We input the correct answer on the gameboard (which is alternating red and blue) and noticed that we got a “Correct!” alert. Then, we deleted a row, and noted that we got the expected output, which was an “Incorrect” alert when we clicked the submit button


5. After a user logs in, they should be taken to their student dashboard

  - We tested this by logging in with a username and password, and noted that the login button did indeed take us to our student dashboard.
